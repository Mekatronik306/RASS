# Regenerative Active Suspension System
Open source implementation of a regenerative active suspension system (RASS) in matlab and simulink

## Built with
+ Matlab R2023b
+ Simulink
+ Stateflow 

## Usage
The following Matlab file needs to be run to load the parameters used by the model in Simulink:
```
RASS_parameters.m
```

The function used by the Simulink model to simulate road input:
```
road_input.m
```

The Simulink/Stateflow model:
```
RASS.slx
```
